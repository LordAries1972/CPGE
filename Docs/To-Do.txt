=================================
PLATFORM EXPANSION PREPARATION:
=================================
*** Cross-Platform Abstraction
Status: WINDOWS-ONLY CURRENTLY

Current: Heavy Windows API dependencies
Suggested:

Platform abstraction layer
Linux/macOS support preparation
Console platform consideration


=================================
Rendering API Expansion
=================================
Status: DIRECTX 11 PRIMARY
