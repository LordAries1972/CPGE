Daniel J. Hobson of Australia is a veteran Systems Analyst and Architect Designer with over 35+ years of professional experience designing for past and present 
systems, analyzing, and building real-time, embedded, both gaming & business systems. He is the founder and lead developer of the 
**CPGE – Cross Platform Gaming Engine**, a modular, high-performance engine written entirely in C++ 17 standards and strategies.

His career spans decades of enterprise systems design, low-level API development, multimedia pipeline construction, and platform abstraction 
strategies. Daniel is known for his insistence on **strict compliance**, **zero third-party reliance**, and **hardware-level performance tuning** — traits 
that are fully realized in the CPGE codebase.

## About the CPGE Project

**CPGE** is a real-time game engine developed with an emphasis on **strict modularity for Rendering**, **Music & SFX Playback**, **thread safety**, and 
**Cross-Platform Compatibility** on all major operating systems — With that said, all systems are written from scratch, with no reliance
to ensure complete control and transparency over behavior, performance, and debugging when required, and as you develope your own gaming/application system.

### ✅ Supported Operating Systems
- Windows 10 and above
- Linux (Desktop)
- Android
- iOS
- MacOS

Versions of the required OS's above that are missing, will be given later as development proceeds as at this point in time, who knows what may be upgraded!!!

### 🎮 Graphics API Rendering Support Systems
- DirectX 11
- DirectX 12
- OpenGL
- Vulkan

These four Render Engines above, will cover all OS (Operating System) platforms.

### 🔊 Audio and Media Backends
- DirectSound (WAV support)
- Media Foundation (MP3, M4A playback)
- QuickTime (platform integration)
- Custom XM (Fast Tracker 2) module player with full effect support

### 📆 Scene Management
- In-house GLTF 2.0 (.gltf) parser (fully working), .glb will be added soon!
- Supports dynamic loading of models, lights, and cameras
- Model instances are isolated from base assets to prevent data corruption and faster re-loading times (Cacheing)

### 🚀 Engine Capabilities
- Instance-based rendering with full constant buffer separation.

- Fade-in/fade-out logic for both Visual and/or sounds and music.
  Including the ability to set within a XM Pattern structured playlist
  and where to go next at an instance.  This allows the user to write
  muliple songs within one XM Tracker file which will save lots of memory
  as per to things like an individual single MP3 file.

- Threaded asset loading and audio playback for MP3/M4A or XM Tracker files.
- Shader fallback diagnostics with color-coded output for GPU error tracing.
- Strict pre-validation of model and buffer data before setup or rendering.
- Check-Summed Configuration file to prevent anti-tampering!
- Game Pad/Joystick Operations for both 2D and 3D gaming Scenarios.
- Queing SFX Management System.
- Threading System.
- FX Engine for special pre-built effects for both 2D and 3D systems.
- GUI (Graphics User Interface) Intuition System.
- 2D Blitting Queue based on leveling.
- 3D Model Handling System.
- Scene Management via Compatible GLTF 2.0 formats / or singular OBJ files.
- Keyboard and Mouse Interventions.

- And so much more, and yet much more to come!!!

## Development Philosophy

Daniel's philosophy is built on precision and stability:
- **Strict AI Compliance Mode** ensures code correctness, traceability, and standards adherence.

- **No third-party wrappers** — all functionality (Besides only Steam, GooglePlay, iOS AppStore is only for the
  Commercial User! (Have NO Choice on this!)) is handcrafted, including model parsers, XM playback, MP3 streaming,
  and all the rest of it!!!

- JSON Parser is by Niels Lohmann and his work also too falls under the MIT License.  See below for his GitHUB link.

- **Debug-centric design** — with deep diagnostics, color-coded shader fallbacks, and verbose logging for every subsystem; do not worry, you mess up, I got ya back!
- **Platform-first design** — ensuring compatibility across multiple operating systems and graphics backends.

## Licensing

This kind of system level of frame-work programming has never been released by no one, 
because they all want to make their super $$$ for their games; which of course, is fair enough I suppose!

This System comes Free-To-Use for study/personal or Commercial purposes for free.  

All that you are required to do, is simply state in your game or application, that the Engine is based on the 
"CPGE (Cross Platform Gaming Engine)" and that is it folks and that is the only mandatory thing I ask for using this engine.
(Please always give recognition to those who ever helped you!!!).

This Engine is a public go-to system for Game Development and is strictly free to use, based on given recognition, 
including alterations on your behalf and to ensure that the basis of your work is from CPGE and is mentioned within.

WHAT A GREAT DEAL IS WHAT I SAY and is the time to stop the RORTING ON gaming as well!!! 
(ie. Mobile Gotcha games, absolutely wrong and criminal imho).  Keep ya prices low, everyone 
then, has to follow if that is the said, marketing price.  With your help, we can make that happen and 
more importantly, demonstrates the very power of the people and FOSS (Free Open-Source Software)!
