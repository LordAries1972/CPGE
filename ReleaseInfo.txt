DirectX 11 & 12, OpenGL & Vulkan Game Engine originally started and programmed for Windows 11, Linux, MacOS and Android
and future operating systems by Daniel J. Hobson of Australia 2023-2025

The Licence of use of this software system comes under Docs\LICENSE.md

The simple idea behind all this, is that the engine is Cross Platform functional, which includes textures,
lighting, shading, blending, shadowing, specular effects, Input Handling (ie. Keyboard, Joystick),
Extensive Debugging Programmatical Options, Sound FX (SoundManager) / and a Multi Music system that plays either 
.MP3 or .XM (Fast Tracker 2) file formats.

Please note that all code for now here is C++17 Standard Compliant!

Once a base (Direct X11) is complete, project will be released to open community for Future Contribution, Growth and Potential Use
by any given user.

As more is to be implemented, more case tools will be introduced which help game developers
setup their required gaming environment and to use with the selected Engine.

====================
DEVELOPMENT HISTORY: -
====================
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
11/09/2023 - Original Project Started (Many writes, rewrites as building core Interface Modules was the focus here)
01/01/2025 - Restarted Conceptual idea and restructured code more efficiently as prior project lead to many problems in the end.
             Engine was fine and working, but very poorly designed as it was a build/test and learnt various things as we went along.
02/01/2025 - Put Project into GITHUB privately and to learn its' abilities with projects.  So for myself, Daniel, I had to learn GITHUB!!!
07/01/2025 - XM Module Player and Class created (Not completed yet nor working!)
11/03/2025 - A Proper Debug Class for Debug Execution so level information can be displayed
             to the Output window of Microsoft Visual Studio 2019/2022.

12/03/2025 - Created a ThreadManager Class that manages safely our required threads (ThreadManager.h/.cpp)

14/03/2025 - Added DirectX Camera class object.  See DXCamera.h/.cpp for more info.

15/03/2025 - Now we see FPS and Our Mouse Cursor on Screen.
           - The Startup, Processing and Closure of the Loader Thread (LoaderTaskThread)
             is now implemented and working.

           - The Startup, Processing and Closure of the Render Thread (RenderFrame)
             is now implemented and working at this point.

           - Loading of 2D Textures is now implemented.
           - Our Custom Mouse Pointer now working and showing on screen. Basic DirectDraw pipe-line is considered working!
           - Basic Scene Functionality is now operational.

           - Blitting of 2D Objects with Transparency now operational.
           - Added the SteamWorks Class & SDK include files to work with Steam Gaming Platform (Currently not implemented)
		   
16/03/2025 - Implemented a full functional MP3 Player (Threaded) using the
             WindowsMedia API.  See (WinMediaPlayer.h) for more details.

           - Implemented a full functional Joystick/Gamepad Handler that supports the loading &
             saving of gamepad mappings.  This will need some more work later down the track
             where we will actually run a mapping interface for users. May or May NOT need to
             use as I am NOT sure what the SteamWorks API offers in regards to this for gamepads 
             currently at the moment.

             UPDATE: (14/05/2025) CPGE Engine now supports its own Joystick/Gamepad controlling!
             Please revise Joystick.h/.cpp for more more information.

           - Made it optional so that the engine can run the RenderFrame() as a thread or as
             a call within the Main Message Loop.  

           - Implemented a SysUtils class that contains functions that are related specifically
             to the Windows Operating system (see WinSystem.h for more info).
           - Added a system check in main.cpp to ensure users are operating on Windows 10 or above for DirectX usage. 
17/03/2025 - Detection of a GPU Presence.
18/03/2025 - Added support for a Playlist in the MP3Player Class.
           - Single song when played through the MP3Player Class will now restart the song again when finished.
             I will update this later to support DirectX and other playback devices. 

21/03/2025 - Improvements to the ThreadManager Class.  See ThreadManager.h for more details.
25/03/2025 - Implemented the GUIManager system which is responsible for creating custom windows with
             supported custom controls.  In turn, this manages the handling of all input and assigned events
             before rendering (2D Draw/Image support only atm).
26/03/2025 - More Improvements to the GUIManager class (see GUIManager.h/.cpp files for more info)
27/03/2025 - Started in the individual .cpp files (Classes) on how to use the classes appropriately.  These will be updated
             and revised upon changes.  The idea is that way, developers understand their true implementation process.
28/03/2025 - Implemented the Sound Manager system that is responsible for Sound Playback. see SoundManager.h/.cpp files for more info.
29/03/2025 - Implemented the FX Manager which now handles various screen fading routines. see FXManager.h/.cpp files for more info.
30/03/2025 - FX Manager now supports various scrolling fx for Tiled Images.  Many more FX Types to come!
           - Moving Windows in GUIManager is fluent and are snappable.
01/04/2025 - Big update here and Major restructuring has taken place:-
             1) XMMODPlayer class is now fully functional and complete (A lot of people are going to love this module alone)
                uses DirectX Sound for playback.  More options will be implemented later.

                I will start writing up some documents soon to explain how this is to be used.  
                See the Constants.h, IOThreadStream.cpp & XMMODPlayer.h/.cpp files for more info.

             2) The Major work has gone towards the restructuring of the project and preparing it 
                more ready for Cross Platform systems which I cannot wait to start.

03/04/2025 - More restructuring in regards to the rendering system with much more simplier usage against appropriate renderer.
             See main.cpp, Render.h, RendererMacros.h & RendererFactory.cpp for more info.
             
           - Reworked the SoundManager Class and enhanced it as well.  It was currently using XAudio2, but now uses DirectSound
             for the Windows Platform.  XAudio2 was causing major problems so it was dropped for now, will re-introduce this support later!
             
04/04/2025 - Window Resizing is now fully operational.
           - More Enhancements to the XMMODPlayer Class (see XMMODPlayer.h/.cpp) for more details.

05/04/2025 - Added AI Assistance Documentation under the GIT /Docs folder (Open in MS Word / Browser or HTML Compliant Application.

09/04/2025 - 3D OBJ Models are now showing up using textures, normalMaps, lighting and shading without a scene manager (Consider this as 
             a manual load option to render model objects for learners).  All models here are allocated as BASE models only!

           - Working Possible way to debug your pixel shader! See ModelPShader.hlsl and RenderFrame() for more info.
           - For systems like mine, which have multiple GPU's, system will use detected NVIDIA/AMD devices as priority!
           - Camera system now fully implemented, while movement is done whilst the right mouse button is held  
             down and the mouse wheel to zoom in & out.  General movement will come a little later after the Scene Manager is more working.
           - Basic model animations has been implemented (Needs much more work)
           - Atomics properly corrected and used (May need to fix a few more, but working on them!)

15/04/2025 - Wireframe Switching now operational, press F2 to toggle the mode.

16/04/2025 - Major work on the Scene Manager using the .GLTF/.bin 2.0 format, approximately about 75% completed at this point (So NOT working fully atm!)

17/04/2025 - Debugging Enhancements: logLevelMessage() and logDebugMessage() (paramatized) also output to given debug file and utilising date/time 
             stamping as well.  See Debug.h/cpp for more info.

18/04/2025 - DXCamera.h/.cpp has had a major re-work and is now functioning correctly.
           - You can now move through your scene using the Cursor Keys to navigate; use Mouse with right button down for changing 
             your yaw/pitch movements and your Mouse Wheel to Zoom in/out.

19/04/2025 - Teaching AI Policy / Rules Enforcement!!!  See policies Docs/POLICIES.txt for more information!  This is something I, only me, 
             will generate and update over time - Keep Sharp! if your are new and/or considered as a VIBE AI Programmer and wanting
             to learn how to USE AI (ChatGPT / Claude / Gemini etc) command programming / debugging task purposing CORRECTLY!
             See Docs folder for more info.

           - Configuration update to hold new mandatory settings see Configuration.h/.cpp for more information; In Conclusion, this 
             will be CheckSum Enforced!

24/04/2025 - STABLE: Basic GLTF 2.0 Scene Model Parsing and Rendering is now functional, wireframe works great, but pixel shader atm 
             is not functioning properly.

26/04/2025 - STABLE: GLTF 2.0 Parser has been optimized and is now fully functional, and now supporting basic lighting 
             (See SceneManager.h/.cpp & Models.h/.cpp for more info).  I will add Documentation later as this will explain a few
             things that you will need to be aware of, especially, if you are wanting this to work correctly.
29/04/2025 - Resizing Window / Reloading / Re-Initialization of Scene Lost Data / Clean exit.

30/04/2025 - STABLE: On Rezing, Camera is left at current position and NOT reset.
           - Fixed Loader-Ring Animation Bug.

05/05/2025 - Fixed SceneManager to handle Sketchfab GLTF parsing (More work will be needed here), but generally works good!
             2D Particle Explosion (Fireworks) Effect has now been added to the FXManager Class.  See DX_FXManager.h/.cpp for more details.

12/05/2025 - Game Pad/Joystick Implementation has now been fully integrated and working 100% and supports both 2D and 3D scenarios
             (Camera movement).  More work will be done with the Camera at a later date such as Animate Movement to (x, y, z) etc.

16/05/2025 - STABLE: Thread Safe Video Rendering which supports .AVI/.MP4 or .MKV files.  This interface allows you to use video 
             streaming without sound.  The idea behind this is that most game developers will create a video and overlap that video 
             playback with a music/audio sound track to support their own video. For games, video is usually rendered via a 3rd 
             party rendering system that is external to this gaming engine platform.  See MoviePlayer.h/.cpp for more info.

17/05/2025 - Scene Sequencing is now in place, the application starts with a splash screen, a intro movie and then into the 
             SCENE_GAMEINTRO (Game Start Area).
           - 3D Starfield effect has now been implemented into the FXManager.

18/05/2025 - Set Exclusive Fullscreen and Transitioning is now fully working.
             RenderFrame() now invidualises scenes aka FUSI (Fully Utilize Scene Implementation) appropriately with correct rendering stages. 

21/05/2025 - ThreadManager now supports Locking/Unlocking and CheckLock/TryLock functions.  See ThreadManager.h/.cpp for more info.
23/05/2025 - FXManager now supports various text scroller routines such LTOR, RTOL, Consistent and Movie Scroller.
             See DX_FXManager.h/.cpp for more details.  Example usage can be found under Docs/FXManager-TextScrollers-Example-Usage.txt
           - Introduction to the MathPrecalculation Class see MathPrecalculation.h/.cpp for more information.
             Comprehensive Example Usage can be found in Docs/MathPrecalculation-Example-Usage.txt

25/05/2025 - Exclusive Full Screen mode via given screen mode (width, height) and transistioning is now working.  This mode 
             is launched by default on RELEASE compiles.
           - Renderer engine now working correctly as a thread - New Lock Mechanism done earlier in ThreadManager.h/.cpp has corrected
             this issue (Sweet!)

[ FUTURE ]   OK EVERYONE, PEOPLE NEED TO RELISE HERE THAT THIS IS VERY CLOSE TO GAMING PRODUCTION FOR DIRECTX 11 SYSTEMS! (WINDOWS 10 SP1 & above 64BIT)
             Alot of this work, MY TIME and for free, it's what you get paid for right? Your story, your graphics and your 
             enginuity based on this platform!  Please DO NOT START A GAME until your comfortable with a release of our marked as [STABLE]
             release! Which means, there should be no crashes nor any cleanup faults including memory leaks!

             Always fully test the GITHUB (Base) code, before starting your project!

             I will always be updating the CPGE Engine until I die and your code base here is always free under the MIT License!

             I will announce an official stable release on GitHub AND then make public so it is ready for gaming production 
             for those who are eager to try this out and right now, or DirectX 11 Gaming Platforms on Windows 10/11 
             64 Bit operating systems AS it is not completely gone yet!
