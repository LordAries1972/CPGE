# Cross Platform Gaming Engine (CPGE)

Welcome to the Cross Platform Gaming Engine (CPGE) repository which was originally co-founded & designed by Daniel J. Hobson of Melbourne, Australia 2023-2025!

## Introduction

CPGE is a powerful and flexible gaming engine designed to work across multiple platforms. It aims to provide an easy-to-use C++ Class Modules interface for game developers while maintaining high performance and scalability.

The idea of this is to give the developer a great starting frame-work to use with a game or system that they want to develop and the objective of this is to make it work across all platforms (Yes a big project!).  To use
this successfully, you will need a very good understanding on C/C++ programming, especially on the targeted O/S you want to develop it for as some things can vary from each platform.

## Features

- Support for multiple platforms (Windows (DirectX 11 & DirectX 12), macOS, iOS, Linux & Android)
- High-performance rendering
- Flexible and modular architecture
- Extensive documentation and tutorials
- Active community support

## What you could achieve with CPGE so far!
- With our First Release, you can now create a full working 2D game using the 2D Rendering system via DirectX 11 (DirectX 12 will be soon).  

Game Configuration, 
Music & Sounds, 
Faders, 2D Partical Explosion, 3D Starfield, Various Text Scrollers,
File Loader System & FileIO Management system, 
Thread Safety Management, 
Mouse input, Joystick/Gamepad & Keyboard, 
Player Management, 
Tiled Map Loading, 
Pack/Unpacking routines, 
Math Precalculation system,
Networking, 
Game AI,
Scene Management,
Randomizer & 
Custom Windows and Controls. 

Basically everything you need to create a standard 2D Based Looking Gamimg system on the Windows 10 SP1 / 11 64bit Operating Systems.

- We are now using scenes which consist of all models (including textures, bumps etc), Camera and lighting within a 3D Project.  For you to use this successfully, consider using a 3D Modeller package that can export GLTF 2.0 formats (Free to use system).  I, myself, uses Blender v4 and above which is also free to use.  You can find it above under the Important Links section above.

## Documentation
- Documents and example usages to this project can be found within the Docs folder.

## Demos
There are several demos that you can view to see the capabilites of CPGE.  I will be moving all these at a later date once a web site is established.  Stay Tuned!

## Known Issues
These are the following known issues and will be resolved as humanly possible.

1) Window Resizing in Window Mode.

## Getting Started

To get started with CPGE, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/LordAries1972/CPGE.git
   cd CPGE
   ```
2. **Contribution to repository:**
   ```sh
   Only work on files that relate to the CPGE project itself, do NOT start your own game or system within the base CPGE folder.
   If you want to start a project of your own, please copy the CPGE folder to a new location and use that instead with your
   chosen IDE / Compiling system.  If you are NOT using Visual Studio 2019/2022 then you may need to setup the project in
   your chosen IDE.
   ```
